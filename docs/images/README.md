# Screenshots

Place project screenshots here to keep README clean:

- `vscode-status.png`: VS Code with Baseline status bar and diagnostics visible.
- `vscode-quickfix.png`: The Quick Fix action inserting a guard/fallback snippet.
- `html-report.png`: The HTML adoption report (filters and grouping visible).
